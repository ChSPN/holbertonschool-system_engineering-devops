# Simple Web Infrastructure Design - foobar.com

## Project Overview
This project involves designing a simple web infrastructure using a single server that hosts a website reachable via www.foobar.com. The infrastructure includes a web server (Nginx), an application server, a MySQL database, and a domain name (foobar.com) configured with a DNS record that points to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

## Key Components:
1 Server (with IP 8.8.8.8)
1 Web Server (Nginx)
1 Application Server (Running the codebase)
1 Database (MySQL)
1 Domain Name (foobar.com with a www subdomain)
